## My personal website: <a href="https://cameronshum.com/">cameronshum.com</a>

A display of both my design and development knowledge, and a sandbox environment for me to try new technologies.

Built off my design philosophies:

1. Unique components
2. Extensible and Modular
3. Minimalistic
4. Unrestricting and intuitive user interfaces

To Do:

1. Spotify integration - to display the current playing song on Spotify
2. Run tracker - a mapbox display of my daily runs, and hurdle progress
3. Interest section - to show off my interests ( mainly hurdling)
4. Ideas - notion plug-in to programmatically display a list of projects I want to build
